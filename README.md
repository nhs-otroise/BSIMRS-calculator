# BSIMRS Calculator

An online risk stratification tool for Gram-negative bacteraemias.

Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Gram-negative bacilli account for nearly 50% of the cases of BSI. A risk score has been developed to predict the prognosis of patients at the time of diagnosis with Gram-negative BSI based on:

- The Pitt bacteraemia score,
- Source of infection,
- and two major comorbid medical conditions.

The BSI mortality risk score (BSIMRS) has high prognostic ability to predict mortality in adult patients with Gram-negative BSI. This online calculator aims to make this simpler, and much quicker, to calculate.
