		<div class="text-box">Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Gram-negative bacilli account for nearly 50% of the cases of BSI. A risk score has been developed to predict the prognosis of patients at the time of diagnosis with Gram-negative BSI based on:
		<ul>
			<li>The Pitt bacteraemia score,</li>
			<li>Source of infection,</li>
			<li>and two major comorbid medical conditions.</li>
		</ul>
		The BSI mortality risk score (BSIMRS) had high prognostic ability to predict mortality in adult patients with Gram-negative BSI.
